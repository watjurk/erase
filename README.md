# Erase

_Erase_ is a very simple utility to permanently erase file or folder.

# Installation

1. Install [golang](go.dev/doc/install)
2. run `go install github.com/watjurk/erase`

Now you can use the `erase` command!

# Usage

To erase file or folder simply run `erase "<path>"`  
Remember to add those quotations because paths with spaces will cause problems without quotations, and you could end up erasing the wrong stuff!
